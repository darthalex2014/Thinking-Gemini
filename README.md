# Thinking Gemini

Let Gemini think comprehensively before responding!

> **A super quick reminder:**
> Thinking Gemini **is not aimed for benchmarks or huge leaps in math or something**, since those are pre-determined by the base model.
> I only want to explore how further we could reach with Gemini's "deep mindset". That said, when using it in your daily tasks, you will find Gemini's inner monolog (thinking process) very very fun and interesting.

## Overview

This project consists of:
1. **Thinking Protocol**: A comprehensive set of instructions that guides Gemini to think deeply and systematically before responding

The project is organized into:
- `model_instructions/`: Thinking protocols for different versions
  - Contains versioned instruction sets
  - Each version brings improvements to Gemini's thinking process

## Thinking Protocol

The thinking protocol instructs Gemini to follow a natural, thorough thought process before providing responses.

## Why Use Thinking Gemini?

- **Better Reasoning**: Get more thorough and well-thought-out responses
